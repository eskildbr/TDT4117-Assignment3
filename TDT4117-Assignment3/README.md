# TDT4117-Assignment3

For this assignment I worked with Peder Hanch-Hansen Espen, phespen@stud.ntnu.no

For the most part the assignment was alright, had to get quite alot of help from TAs on certain parts though. A pretty substantial assignment, but was quite fun and nice to get some practical use out of what we learned so far. There are some comments in the code, though its mostly taken from the assignment sheet or is otherwise pretty standard.

I also had lots of trouble with installing nltk on my mac and ended up having to factory reset my mac in order to fix this, plus other problems. We then had to work mainly on one pc which made it a bit harder. Because of this the code is next to similar, but since we are working together that should not cause any problems.
